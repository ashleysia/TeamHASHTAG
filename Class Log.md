================
In class:
* Kristina announced that feedback on what grade you will have in this class will be given on Tuesday
* Raymond and Ashley talked to Aaron about what our roles should be going on into the future of this project.
* Aaron announced that there is a possible opportunity to speak with Chancellor Dirks and the latest Berkeley Nobel Laureate at the Data Science Fair (more info TBA)

Accomplishments since last class:
* Ashley is now the operational lead to coordinate what will happen when/if we meet with Chancellor Dirks
* Raymond is the current operational and technical lead for the D3 team

Goals for next class:
* Figure out where you belong now


November 19, 2013
================
The analyzers gather in a separate room to have a conference call with Luen.
Raymond and Vincent are looking at various D3 visualizations and figuring out what type of interactive plot/graph/visual
we can use for the purpose of this class. Learning coding by looking at already written out codes.
Looking into improving the plot that Tim have accomplished and see if there's any wiggle room to expand on that.
Yoojin will be looking into R further.

================
In class: 
* We heard 3 presentations. One was a basic understanding of earthquakes. One at more regarding the ETAS model. The last was regarding suggestions of ways to approach this project per Professor Stark.
* Reena and Tim have accomplished their goals in helping our group and will proceed to join other groups (Thanks guys! :) )

Accomplishments since last class:
* Reena and Ashley finished visualizing data over time in R.
* Tim finished visualizing data geographicly in iPython.
* Raymond concluded that using D3 would not be an efficient use of our time.

Goals for next class:
* Decide what new goal we will accomplish that is parallel to other vertical groups, or join new vertical groups

The game plan going into the future: 

We will be visualizing raw earthquake data over 2 different graphs- time series and geographic.

The time series graph will be a line plot showing earthquake magnitude from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2012. 
Team:
Ashley @ashleysia
Reena
David 

Deadline: Hopefully within the next week. We can adjust accordingly, but Carl wants this done ASAP. 

The geographic graph will hopefully show a world map with the little circles that represent the magnitude of the quakes. There are some D3 models for this, but if that isn't tangible we can just use the code from the last project we did.
Team:
Raymond  (Learning / looking into d3 as a viable option to use as a display tool) 
Vincent  (using existing R code or make new one that portrays quake data on a gepgraphical map) 
Yoojin  
Tim

Deadline: Hopefully within the next 2 weeks or so. like probably the 21st at the latest. Again, Carl wants this done ASAP but I told him this one will take more time than the line plot.

Just to reiterate, one of our main purposes is to prove that there is a need to do models. Like if earthquakes could be predicted by time or geography, then there would be no need for this project. We are also helping the rest of the visualizers by giving them a pictures to start with. I'm not very good at explaining it ... so if someone wants to help me out in better wording our purpose (like Tim .. I heard you talking about it to Carl and you spoke really well about it), that'd be great.
