NOTE: This was what we came up with for class on November 5, 2013. Some of this information may be outdated.

Task:
=========

Visualize raw earthquake data (Time Series)
- create graph of the RAW earthquake data
- donâ€™t have ETAS/Stark model yet
- CDF for earthquake occurences
- refine code for plotting earthquakes for particular regions
- make it dynamic to location

The SMART Goals:
=========

* Figure out what kind of graph(embedded in R) will be best for showing RAW earthquake data
* Figure out what parameters will be received from the analyzers to input into graphs
* Create skeleton for seismic and time series graphs
* Create a way so that graphs will be dynamic to location
